MiCRO - Minimally Conscious Random Optimization
-----------------------------------------------

A toy optimization algorithm based on random optimization.

Use gaussian.py to test with a 2D Gaussian example.  Use an output
directory (e.g. 'frames') to write images of the swarm showing
convergence over time.
